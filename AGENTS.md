# DailyDash — Agent Guide

## Project Identity
Single-module Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose). The **app label is "DailyDash"**; the package/module name is `com.macrotracker`. Keep both names in mind — they differ intentionally.

**Ship note:** When the user asks to commit/push, follow **[Commit, push & release](#commit-push--release-mandatory-when-user-asks)** so GitHub Releases + in-app What's New stay accurate (message quality, no manual version bumps, no `[skip ci]` on real changes).

## Build & API Keys
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug      # standard debug build
./gradlew installDebug       # build + deploy to connected device
```
**Do not assemble, install, or run the app to verify UI.** The user keeps an Android emulator in the same directory as this project and checks changes themselves.

API keys go in `local.properties` (never committed):
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=...
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=...   # optional locally; required for confidential Twitch apps / CI search
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...       # GitHub OAuth App Client ID for the home GitHub card (Device Flow; no secret in the APK)
GITHUB_TOKEN=...           # optional PAT fallback if OAuth Client ID is not set
```
**GitHub Releases:** `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml` writes the same keys from repo Actions secrets into `local.properties` before `assembleRelease`. Required for Twitch in published APKs: `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID`, `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Required for GitHub Connect in published APKs: Actions secret `GH_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` (OAuth App Client ID — **not** a PAT and **not** the automatic Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN`; GitHub forbids secrets named `GITHUB_*`). CI writes it as `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` in `local.properties`. Optional mirrors of local keys: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`. YouTube **Connect Google** does not use BuildConfig keys — it needs Google Cloud Console (YouTube Data API v3 + Android OAuth client for package `com.macrotracker` + `tester.jks` SHA-1); CI already signs releases with `app/tester.jks`.

At runtime, Settings lets the user pick **Gemini**, **OpenAI**, or **OpenRouter** and enter the matching API key. For OpenRouter, Settings also shows a curated cheap-model picker with list prices. Stored keys take priority over build-time keys. `NutritionAiRepository` / `WeatherAiRepository` / widget insights all route through `AiApiClient` based on `SettingsRepository.aiProvider`.

## Key Patterns

### Dependency Injection
Hilt throughout. `AppModule.kt` is the only `@Provides` module. Concrete implementations are bound to interfaces via separate abstract `@Binds` modules (`F1DataModule`, `YouTubeDataModule`, `TwitchDataModule`, `GitHubDataModule`). **Glance widgets cannot receive injected deps normally** — they use `EntryPointAccessors`, e.g. `F1RepositoryEntryPoint`.

### UI State
Each screen's ViewModel exposes sealed-class state via `StateFlow`. Example pattern from `HomeViewModel`:
```kotlin
sealed class WeatherUiState { object Loading; data class Success(...); data class Error(val message: String) }
private val _weatherState = MutableStateFlow<WeatherUiState>(WeatherUiState.Loading)
val weatherState: StateFlow<WeatherUiState> = _weatherState
```

When a sealed interface is shared across a screen and its sub-components, it lives in its own file (e.g. `F1UiState.kt` in `ui/viewmodel/`).

Health Connect metrics use `HealthMetricUiState(value, today, yesterday, isEnabled)` from `ui/components/BodyStats.kt`. Use `calculatePercentageChange(today, yesterday)` to derive the delta arrow shown on each metric card.

**Throttled loading pattern** — both `DashboardViewModel` and `HealthViewModel` skip reloads if called within 30 s of the last load:
```kotlin
fun loadDataThrottled() {
    if (lastLoadMs > 0 && System.currentTimeMillis() - lastLoadMs < 30_000L) return
    loadData()
}
```
`DashboardViewModel.loadData()` also cancels any in-flight job first (`loadJob?.cancel()`) to prevent pile-up on rapid calls.

### Navigation
`DailyDashNavHost` owns all routes. The **`SplashOverlay` is a full-window Compose overlay** placed above the `Scaffold` in `MainScreen` — it is **not a nav destination** and lives in `OnboardingViewModel.splashShown`. The rest of the onboarding flow (`WelcomeScreen`, `PermissionsScreen`, `TutorialScreen`) **are** nav destinations via `OnboardingRoutes.WELCOME/PERMISSIONS/TUTORIAL`. Transitions are defined exclusively in `MacroMotion` (`ui/theme/Animation.kt`); do not hardcode tween/spring values elsewhere.

Sub-screens (`stats`, `help`, `camera_scan`) are composed inside `DailyDashNavHost` with `MacroMotion.subScreenEnter/Exit/PopEnter/PopExit` transitions and are navigated to imperatively from their parent screens (e.g. `SettingsScreen` → `help`, `AIScreen`/`HealthScreen` → `camera_scan`).

### Home Screen Widgets (draggable)
Widget order and visibility are persisted as a single colon-and-comma encoded string in SharedPrefs:
```
"WEATHER:true,CALENDAR:true,BODY_STATS:true,PROGRESS:true,QUICK_ADD:true,F1:true,GITHUB:true,YOUTUBE:true,TWITCH:true"
```
`DraggableWidgetColumn` + `WidgetEditor` read/write this via `SettingsRepository`. **`GITHUB`** is the home GitHub hub (`GitHubCard`): account-wide issues, PRs, activity, and repos for the connected GitHub user (not a single project). Connect with Device Code OAuth on the Account tab (`repo` + `read:user`).

The **Health screen** uses the same draggable pattern with a separate key (`healthWidgetOrder`):
```
"DAILY_HEALTH:true,ACTIVITIES:true,BODY_STATS:true,HISTORY:true,SUMMARY:true,ADD_ENTRY:true,WEEK_AT_A_GLANCE:true,RECENT_LOGS:true"
```
`DAILY_HEALTH` is the hero Daily Health card (Apple-style activity rings + dynamic today metrics). **`ACTIVITIES`** lists recent workouts synced through Health Connect (Garmin Connect, Google Fit, Samsung Health, Strava, and others): type, source, duration, distance, pace, heart rate, elevation, and a GPS route map when the session includes one. `WEEK_AT_A_GLANCE` is the Macro Trends widget (7/14/30-day nutrition chart + per-day food logs), moved from the former History tab.

### App Widgets (Glance)
All Glance widgets are refreshed together via `WidgetUpdater.updateAllWidgets(context)` (call from the app) or `WidgetRefreshWorker` (periodic WorkManager task, 30-min interval, requires network). F1 widgets share a disk/memory cache through `F1WidgetDataProvider`. Full widget list: `DashboardWidget`, `MacrosWidget`, `HealthWidget`, `WeatherWidget`, `CalendarWidget`, `F1CountdownWidget`, `F1StandingsWidget`, `F1ScheduleWidget`.

`DashboardWidgetDataProvider` reads Room, Health Connect, weather cache, and calendar directly without Hilt (same no-injection pattern as `F1WidgetDataProvider` — use `EntryPointAccessors` when an interface is needed). `WidgetComponents.kt` houses all shared Glance composables and the `WidgetSizes` grid-constant object (cell formula: `74×n − 2 dp`; min 2×2, max 5×3).

F1 widget theming goes through `F1WidgetColors.kt`: instantiate `F1Clr` for the palette, call `teamColorProvider(hex)` to parse a team hex string into a Glance `ColorProvider`, and `podiumColor(position, c)` for gold/silver/bronze medal colours. Status tags (last-updated, stale, syncing) are rendered via `F1WidgetStatus.kt` (`F1WidgetStatusTag`, `statusTagText`, `f1WidgetEmptyMessage`). The dashboard widget snapshot type is `DashboardWidgetData` in `DashboardWidgetData.kt` (also contains `HourlyForecast` and widget-layer `CalendarEvent`).

### In-app updates (GitHub Releases)
Sideload/tester path — not Play Core. CI publishes `DailyDash-{versionName}-vc{versionCode}.apk` on master merges. `AppUpdateRepository` polls GitHub while foregrounded; `AppUpdateDialog` downloads + `PackageInstaller` self-updates; `UpdateInstallActivity` relaunches `MainActivity` with `EXTRA_RELAUNCHED_AFTER_UPDATE` / `EXTRA_SHOW_WHATS_NEW`. `PackageReplacedReceiver` posts a tap-to-open notification if relaunch is blocked. Post-update, `WhatsNewDialog` shows once (notes cached at download time, enriched from `/releases`). Soft-snooze is 12h (`Later`); Settings badge deep-links to About + opens the update dialog. Key files: `data/update/*`, `ui/components/AppUpdateDialog.kt`, `WhatsNewDialog.kt`, `AppUpdateViewModel`, `.github/scripts/package-release.sh`.

## Commit, push & release (mandatory when user asks)

When the user asks to **commit**, **push**, or **commit and push** (with or without a suggested message), follow the normal git safety rules **and** this release hygiene so the in-app updater + What's New stay correct.

### Pipeline (do not fight it)
1. Push / merge to **`master`** triggers `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`.
2. CI runs `ensure-unique-version.sh` — bumps `versionCode` / `versionName` only if needed, commits `chore: bump version to … [skip ci]`, then builds.
3. `package-release.sh` builds **What's New** from **commit subjects since the previous `v*` tag** (plus PR titles when present), publishes the GitHub Release + `DailyDash-{versionName}-vc{versionCode}.apk`.
4. Installed apps poll GitHub, download, PackageInstaller self-update, relaunch, show What's New.

### Commit message = release notes (critical)
**Your commit subject line is what users see in What's New.** CI copies non-noise subjects from `git log prev_tag..HEAD` into the GitHub Release body; the app shows that body after update.

Write the subject as a human release note:

- **One clear, user-facing sentence** describing what changed and why it matters (imperative or past tense is fine).
- Prefer product language over file lists:  
  ✅ `Refresh Health with clearer metric icons and a cleaner Daily Health card`  
  ✅ `Show clothing icons on the weather card for today's conditions`  
  ❌ `Update AppUpdateRepository.kt and MainScreen.kt`  
  ❌ `wip` / `fix` / `stuff`
- Keep it to the **subject line** (≈72 chars is ideal). Extra body text is fine for reviewers but is **not** used in What's New.
- Do **not** put `[skip ci]` on feature/fix commits (that skips the APK release entirely).
- Do **not** hand-bump `versionCode` / `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts` — CI owns that.
- Do **not** create git tags or GitHub Releases yourself for normal ship flow — the workflow does.
- Noise filtered out of notes: `chore: bump version…`, anything with `[skip ci]`, merge-only titles, `wip` / `fix stuff`.
- If the user supplies a commit message, use it when it is already release-note quality; otherwise lightly tighten it into a clear What's New bullet **without** changing their intent. Confirm only if their message would ship as useless notes (e.g. only `wip`).
- When shipping several changes in one push, either one strong subject covering the theme, or multiple commits each with its own user-facing subject (each becomes its own bullet).

### Push target
- Default ship path: commit on the current branch, then **`git push -u origin HEAD`** (or push the tracked branch).
- If the work is already on **`master`** (or the user asked to ship to master), pushing `master` is what publishes the APK. Prefer that when they said "commit and push" for a finished feature on master.
- If on a feature branch and they did **not** ask to merge/PR, push the branch; remind them the APK releases only after it lands on `master`.
- Never `--force` to `master` / `main`. Never commit secrets (`local.properties`, keystores, API keys).

### After push (when shipping to master)
Briefly tell the user:
- Commit hash + **subject** (this is the What's New bullet).
- That **Build & Release APK** will publish the tester APK with that subject in the release notes.
- They can update from the app (Settings badge / dialog); after install it should reopen with What's New.

### External APIs
| Service | Client | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini / OpenAI / OpenRouter | OkHttp (`AiApiClient`) | Provider + key from Settings; OpenRouter model picker; BuildConfig fallback |
| OpenF1 | Ktor (`HttpClient`) | Base URL `https://api.openf1.org/v1/`; browser User-Agent set in `AppModule` |
| YouTube | RSS feed (OkHttp) + Data API v3 OAuth | Manual channels via RSS; Connect Google imports `subscriptions.list` into Watching |
| Twitch | Helix (OkHttp) + Device Code (Custom Tabs) | `twitch.tv/activate` (no runtime redirect); imports follows; live board (60s cache) |
| Weather | HTTP (WeatherRepository) | AI summary via Gemini |
| Health Connect | SDK | Read-only; lazy client; gracefully returns null if SDK unavailable |
| GitHub (home card) | OkHttp (`GitHubRepository` + `GitHubAuthClient`) | Device Code OAuth (Custom Tabs → github.com/login/device); REST `/user`, search issues/PRs `involves:@me`, `/user/repos`, `/users/{login}/events`; scopes `repo read:user` |
| GitHub Releases | OkHttp (`AppUpdateRepository`) | In-app APK updates + changelog |

### Compose Strong Skipping
`composeCompiler { enableStrongSkippingMode = true }` is set in `app/build.gradle.kts`. Composables with unstable parameters will skip recomposition automatically — avoid fighting this with `@Stable`/`@Immutable` unless you observe real correctness issues.
